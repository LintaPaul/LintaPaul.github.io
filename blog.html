                            Let’s do the famous divide and conquer algorithm to this.

Cyber Security is protecting your digital belongings from the bad guys, if you want a formal definition of Cybersecurity, just Google it...

Chess is a 2-player board game with a set of pieces of a different color. It has a lot of variants, but we can consider Standard Chess for this case. The goal of the game is to checkmate the king. Now, in this case, we as a Cyber Security company are the good guys and the cybercriminals are the bad guys. So, we have to always be active and updated to protect our clients. The blackhat/gray hat hackers always try to come up with new techniques to hack the system and exploit it for their gain. This can have terrible consequences for both the company and our clients. We should not let that happen as it is totally against our core principles. We as a company always try to make a positive impact on society. We want to grow with you<span id="dots">...</span>
<span id="more">
    Coming back to the analogy, we (White pieces) are the white hat hackers and the black pieces are the black hat hackers. They try to checkmate our king, that is stealing our data and do whatever they want...usually, they sell it in the black market or the dark web.

To prevent an organization from getting hacked, we can do a few small things that can benefit all of us. Each and everyone in the organization should have some kind of cybersecurity awareness. This is what we call ‘Cyber hygiene’. This does not guarantee 100% safety no technology or practice can make you or your organization fully safe. We can add several layers of protection to slow down hackers.

Cyber hygiene is a practice that can help you to be safer online. Some common steps include:<br>
<ul>
<li>Keep your apps/Softwares up to date</li>
<li>Have a proper company policy to manage the sensitive data of your clients and employees</li>
<li>Make sure you give importance to physical security as well</li>
<li>Its always recommended having a cybersecurity framework, example: NIST</li>
<li>Have a good incident response team to handle the cyber attacks</li>
<li>Have a good disaster recovery plan in case of any natural calamities/terrorist attacks</li>
Points mentioned above are few and there is always more we can add to it.
</ul>

Furthermore, we have to understand that our cyber world is not safe and we don’t know anything about our opponents. So its always better to keep yourself updated. This is important to stay ahead of your game. Not only that, make sure you gather your information from reliable sources. Information can be of different forms - blogs, news, videos, podcasts, etc.

Some reliable news sources:
<ul>
<li>The New York Times</li>
<li>The Wall Street Journal</li>
<li>The Washington Post</li>
<li>BBC</li>
<li>The Economist</li>
<li>The New Yorker</li>
<li>Wire</li>
<li>Foreign Affairs</li>

If someone says that he/she is a cybersecurity expert, don’t believe them. There is always more to learn as this is an evergreen domain. Apart from that we also have to have some soft skills to be successful in this domain. Some of them are Effective Communication, Adaptability, Collaboration, Determination, and Leadership. One of the most important character I think is persistence. There will also be obstacles in our way. The one who always gets back up and starts running again will be successful.

                        Would you be comfortable living in a house that someone else had the key to? What if an underground tunnel led into it from a public park, or its windows could never quite close all the way? Would you trust it with your safety and your privacy?The internet is that house.

                        This is not to say—never go into the house, but rather, you should know the hazards before you store all of your valuables there—and do what you can to protect them. So why is it insecure, and why can’t we just fortify it until it’s safe?
                        
                        Well, first of all, the internet was not originally built to be what it is today. It’s like someone decided to expand a shoebox into a skyscraper. The internet originally developed when computers were huge and so expensive to own that only universities, big businesses, and a few governments had them. The point, originally, was to let these massive supercomputers talk to each other. And as soon as two computers could send information back and forth, we had a network. The network gradually grew, until personal computers emerged in the 1980s, and then it exploded<span id="dots1">...</span>
                        <span id="more1">
                            Soon people were not just talking to each other, but also exchanging money, playing games, reading news, shopping, and doing everything we associate with the internet today. Other devices started talking to the network too—phones, and cars, and refrigerators, and elevators and power plants, and much much more. But the ease of all of those devices talking to each other came at a price: security.One computer could send another instructions to delete everything on it or take it over—we call these viruses and malware. Or one person could steal another’s identity by guessing, cracking, or extracting a password.

Vulnerabilities such as these will never completely go away, because they’re built into the internet’s very architecture. Criminals use them to steal billions of dollars, governments use them for surveillance, and hacktivists use them to further their political goals. Between 2004 and 2013, over 1 billion records of personal information were stolen or leaked through data breaches of major organizations.

As a thought experiment, let’s imagine what a perfectly secure internet might look like. Users would not be allowed to download or install anything onto their computers. All internet traffic would be monitored and regulated by bots and humans, massively limiting the number of websites you could visit. In order to log onto a website you’d have to type in a 100 character password, submit a genetic sample, and whistle a tune. The servers that hold data would be kept in heavily armed fortresses... on the moon. And even with all of these safeguards in place, some clever hacker would almost certainly still find a way in. The good news is, even with our flawed internet, there are simple things you can do to protect yourself, and there are a lot of people committed to make the internet more secure.

As a cybersecurity expert you play the role of one of these people, protecting a company that is the target of increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks. You must continuously strengthen your defenses in order to thwart these attackers. You will do this by spotting scams designed to trick you into giving up your secrets, and teach you how passwords are cracked and strengthened.

The house that is the internet may be built on a shaky foundation, but it’s been a home to innovation and an unprecedented free exchange of ideas. It’s up to us to make it livable in spite of its flaws.
